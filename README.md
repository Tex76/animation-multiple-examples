# Animated Examples
To run the system, use the command `ionic serve`. The system comprises various examples spread across multiple pages, each accessible through the following URLs:

- http://localhost:8100/home
- http://localhost:8100/second
- http://localhost:8100/third
- http://localhost:8100/fourth
- http://localhost:8100/bee

Please note that the "bee" example is currently incomplete, and I am facing challenges with positioning the bee at the center of the screen.
